*When the user opens the webpage, they are presented with a timed math task to solve. They type their answer, which is sent to the backend for validation. If correct, their streak and points increase, and a new task is generated with a reset timer. If incorrect or time runs out, their streak and points reset, and a sassy mean comment is displayed. The user cannot exit fullscreen mode unless they beat their high score or click a special exit button. Attempting to quit by typing ‚ÄúI QUIT‚Äù shows a cheeky message without exiting fullscreen. A hidden pause button lets the user silently pause and resume the timer, adding a fun secret feature to the game.*
